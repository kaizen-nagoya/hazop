## 1 wiki
"A hazard and operability study (HAZOP) is a structured and systematic examination 
of a complex planned or existing process or operation in order to identify and evaluate problems 
that may represent risks to personnel or equipment."

危険(hazard)および操作性調査（HAZOP）は、人員または機器の恐れ(risk)を表す可能性のある問題を特定および評価するための、
複雑な計画済みまたは既存の処理（process)または操作の構造的かつ体系的な検査です。

"This standard describes the principles for and approach to guide word-driven risk identification. 
Historically this approach to risk identification has been called a hazard and operability study or HAZOP study for short. 
This is a structured and systematic technique for examining a defined system, with the objectives of:"

この規格は、言葉による恐れ(risk)識別を導くための原則とやり方を説明しています。 
歴史的に、この恐れ(risk)識別のやり方は危険(hazard)操作性調査または略してHAZOP調査と呼ばれてきました。
これは、構造化された体系的な手法で、以下の目的で、定義されたシステムを検査します。

##  my opinion
A Hazard and Operability study(HAZOP) is a structured and systematic risk identification method.
Examination of a complex planned or existing operation and or system using 11 guide words, not limited a defined system.
Before define a system, HAZOP guide words are useful.
Hazop is not limited personel and equipment. It is useful all system including an abstruct system which consist of information only like a goal structured notation(GSN).

# Q1 Case Study and the Case Method
What is the difference between study and method.

Related discussion.

## ex.1
The Difference Between a Case Study and the Case Method

https://mba.nucba.ac.jp/en/about-mba/mba-17438.html

" Some claim that “case study” has a passive connotation and “case method” has an active tone, 
while others say that the former should be used to designate the methodology from the viewpoint of the participant, 
and the latter from the perspective of the lecturer. "

「ケーススタディ」には受動的な意味があり、「ケースメソッド」には能動的なトーンがあると主張する人もいれば、
前者は参加者の観点から方法論を指定し、後者は講師の観点から指定するべきだと言う人もいます 。

## ex.2
Is there a difference between the case method and a case study?

http://thetrainingworld.com/faq/casemethod.htm

"The latter is more involving for learners, and forces them into proactive problem-solving rather than posthoc analysis."

後者は学習者の関与がより多く、事後分析ではなく積極的な問題解決を強制します。


## personal opinion
Case study may use case method. Case Study is processes for the problem solving. 
At some processes in case study, case method should be used.

# Q2 structured and systematic
What is the difference between structured and systematic.

## ex.1
Structured vs Systematic - What's the difference?

https://wikidiff.com/structured/systematic

"As adjectives the difference between structured and systematic is that structured is having structure; 
organized while systematic is carried out using a planned, ordered procedure. "

形容詞として、構造化と体系化の違いは、構造化が構造を持っていることです。 
計画的で順序付けられた手順を使用して体系的に実行しながら組織化されます。

##  personal opinion
Structured is having structure and systematic is having system.
Then Waht is the difference between structure and system.

System may have input, output and/or state in the object.
Structure may have the relations of the elements in the object.

Therefore system is typically dynamic and structure is typically satic.

# Q4. process and operation
What is the difference between process and operation.

## ex.1 
Process versus Operation

http://empoweredperformance.com/Portals/0/Observations/Process%20versus%20Operations.pdf

"Operation: as an activity or activities performed on a product or service by a single machine or person.
Process: a sequence of operations (consisting of people, machines, materials, and methods) for the design, manufacture, and delivery of a product or service."

操作：単一の機械または人が製品またはサービスに対して実行する1つまたは複数の活動。
過程：製品またはサービスの設計、製造、および配送のための一連の操作（人、機械、材料、および方法で構成）。


# Q5 
What is the difference between risk and problem.

## ex.1
Risks or Problems – What’s the Difference?
https://svprojectmanagement.com/risks-or-problems-whats-the-difference

"A risk is an uncertain future event that could have a negative effect (threat) or a positive effect (opportunity) on the project objectives. But a problem statement describes a 100% certain condition that exists now and threatens achieving the project objectives. "

恐れ(risk)は、事業の目標に負(negative)の影響（脅威）または正(positive)の影響（機会）を与える可能性がある不確実な将来の事象(event)です。 しかし、問題の記述は、現在存在し、事業の目標の達成を脅かす100％の特定の条件を説明しています。

## ex.2
8 What is the difference between risks, problems and issues?

1. risk is uncertain and problem is certain.
2. risk is positive and/or netagive. problem is negative.
 
##  personal opinion.
A problem may have uncertain causes and/or uncertain effects.
So problem analysis should be included risk analysis.
If you want problem analysis, Hazop is very useful.

# Q6 personnel or equipment.
Is Hazop limited to personnel or equipment?

##  personal opinion
Hazop is not limited to personnel or equipment.
For example, Hazop is very useful to information flow.

So HAZOP is use for system include personnel, equipment and information.

# Q7 planed and/or defined system
Is Hazop limited to defined system?

## planed and existing
planed system is not existing system.


## personal opinion
Hazop is not limited to defined system.

For example, Hazop is very useful to define a system.
"Before" is a Hazop guide word.
"Before" you define a system, Hazop analysis is the best technique.
