# principles

constraints: do 3 times with different people, if more than 9 people

target: each person go to 30 % goal

goal: clarify each goal. 
1. Identify unexpected things.
2. Assuming untested defects.
3.

method: do not explain without 3 times methods

group: devide 3 group with their profile. 


Rotation: 
1. Each group consists of three people.
2. After the first study, change back and forth respectively.
3. After the second study, alos change back and forth respectively.


no delete: do not delete whatever you said or wrote.

classification: don't care about classification.
 After the meeting, facilitator or recorder should reclassificate the result.
 The reclassification should be recorded.

small start: speak first who wrote small items.

debriefing:ã€€each group report most important issue, which other group has not reported.
 If the most important issue is reported from other group, 2nd issue should report.

Conclusion: facilitator conclude the meeting and gather the result.
 If confidential matter are discussed, the treatment should be decided.
 

Summurize:

not declease guide word: 
1.
2.
3. 

use actual goods, photo, movie or chart(use case, sequence chart, state chart or timing chart) 

change: change procedure, people, target, or time.


# Common misconceptions
1. take time
 decide the time of study. 
 If the first experience, and 9 people are joined, a maximum of 2 hours should be recommended.
 
2. It is difficult to understand because it is abstract.
 In the first step or last step, the abstraction is important on this method.
 If you want to custimize the guide words, it is possible.
 But in the first step or the last step, you should check the result using 11 original guide words.
 
3. don't know how far to go.
 Depending on the purpose or goal of the study.
 To find one thing unexpected, 9 people and 2 hours may be the best.
 
4. It is not implemented because it is additional guide words that early and late, and before and after.
