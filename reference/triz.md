Accelerating Science TRIZ inventive methodology in illustrations
Authors: Elena Seraia, Andrei Seryi
Abstract: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a powerful tool widely used in engineering community. It is based on identification of a physical contradiction in a problem, and based on the corresponding pair of contradicting parameters selecting a few of suitable inventive principles, narrowing down the choice and leading to a much faster solution of a probl… ▽ More

Abstract: The menu is one of the most widely used elements of a graphical user interface. The objective of a menu system is to provide various commands and functions to the user in an easy way so that the user can just select the desired operation from a given list instead of typing a complex command in the command prompt. In a conventional menu system the menu items or options are hard-coded in the compu…

This fact is used by a heuristic cleaner to clean the infected file. As the virus knows how to repair the it uses the same virus to repair the infected file. There are some infections where parts of the files are damaged by the virus. The… ▽ More
