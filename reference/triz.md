Protecting Anti-virus Programs From Viral Attacks
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: …market. Besides the anti-virus may use all the obfuscation techniques like polymorphism that the viruses generally use to hide their codes. This article also shows how to use TRIZ Inventive Standards to solve the harmful effects of the viruses on the anti-virus.

10 Inventions on keyboard attachments-A TRIZ based analysis
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: Although the primary objective of the keyboard to input data into the computer, the advanced keyboards keep various other things in mind, such as, how to use the same keyboard for various other purposes, or how to use the same keyboard efficiently by using various other attachments to the keyboard. This objective led to various inventions on keyboard attachments, some of which are illustrated belo…

10 Inventions on improving keyboard efficiency: A TRIZ based analysis
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: …power saving method, keyboard-cooling mechanism, robust keyboard for public use, keyboard enhancement for children’s use. Each of these inventions have been analyzed from TRIZ perspective, in many cases formulating the Ideal Final Result, contradictions and highlighting the Inventive Principles used in the solution.

10 Inventions on Keyboard key layout: A TRIZ based analysis
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: The standard QWERTY keyboard was developed in the late 1800s for the typewriters. As people were acquainted with that the same layout was retained for the computer keyboards. Many people feel that the QWERTY layout is not very efficient layout and there have been many inventions on different layouts of character keys. In order to improve the key arrangement, two major issues should be addressed.…

Methods of Repairing Virus Infected Files, A TRIZ based Analysis
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: Most viruses are capable of fixing up the first few bytes and repair the original program because they have to return the control back to the infected program. This fact is used by a heuristic cleaner to clean the infected file. As the virus knows how to repair the it uses the same virus to repair the infected file. There are some infections where parts of the files are damaged by the virus. The…

Contradictions in Improving Speed of Virus Scanning
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: …methods, although increase the speed of virus scanning, results in disadvantages like load on processor, increase in false positives and compromise on security. The objective of TRIZ is not to accept a tradeoff between the speed of scanning and those other difficulties but to resolve the contradictions so that the speed of scanning increases without compromi…

Finding and Solving Contradictions of False Positives in Virus Scanning
Authors: Umakant Mishra
Abstract: …to detect new and unknown viruses and false positive rate. While a traditional approach tries to achieve a right balance between false positives and false negatives a TRIZ approach looks forward to achieve the Ideal Final Result. The Ideal final result is to 'detect and prevent viruses with full certainty. The chances of error should be nil and the met…
